# bruinsmv.com Repository
This is the repository the deployment files for bruinsmv.com. It is deployed with GitHub pages within a few minutes upon any merges to the main branch. There is also a CI workflow which builds, but does not deploy, the site upon opening a PR. This is a Jekyll-based website, and the deployment is handled via a GitHub Action. The development version of the site has the same workflows, and changes can be tested by force-pushing to the main branch of the [dev.bruinsmv.com repo](https://github.com/UCLA-Bruin-Supermileage/dev.bruinsmv.com) and validating the changes on the live site [dev.bruinsmv.com](https://dev.bruinsmv.com)
